            Hey there, I&rsquo;m Joel J George. I&rsquo;m a final year Data
            Science student with a passion for exploring the ever-evolving world
            of technology and programming. I&rsquo;m on a journey to harness the
            capabilities of programming languages to tackle intricate
            challenges.

            I am passionate about building web applications that are both useful
            and visually appealing. I have been building web apps for around 2
            years, and I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills and
            create more innovative apps. I am excited to continue learning and
            growing as a web developer, and I am eager to share my work with the
            world.
          </p>
          <p className="pt-12 pb-10">
            Beyond coding pursuits, I relish quality moments with family, enjoy
            bike rides, and indulge in shows. I also appreciate quick getaways
            with friends and escaping into the world of books.
